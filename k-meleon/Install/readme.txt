About:
------

K-Meleon is the Windows answer to Galeon. Thus, K-Meleon is a lite Web browser based on gecko 
(the mozilla rendering engine). It's fast, it has a light interface, and it is fully 
standards-compliant. To make it simple, K-Meleon could be considered as the unbloated Mozilla 
version for Windows.

K-Meleon interface tries to mimic the IE MFC interface as much as possible. For convenience, 
it also uses the IE bookmarking system.
